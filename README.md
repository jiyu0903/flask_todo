Simple Flask Todo App using SQLAlchemy and SQLite database.
Updated with full REST API feature.

For styling, [semantic-ui](https://semantic-ui.com/) was used on the original version of the repository. 
To lessen the workload of browsing into semantic-ui.com, I just made the styles inside the Base.html using CSS in this new repository. 


### New Feature (Full REST API)
The new feature allows the Todo list to be used not just through the HTML interface, but also programmaticallyâ€”via API calls.
This means other apps, JavaScript front-ends, or even mobile apps can now create, read, update, and delete todos.
It adds flexibility and modern integration potential, making the app much more powerful and scalable.
